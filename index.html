   <p> John Carmack was born August 20 1970.He attended the University of Missouri-Kansas for two semesters before  withdrawing to work as a freelance programmer.He would lock himself in his room for hour to learn how to code and program.In 1981 he released his first game Wolfenstein which was a hit causing to release 13 other games. The next game he made was Doom released in 1993 it doesn't have as many games with only 6 more being made but there is another one releasing in 2025.In 2013 he partnered with Oculus to make the quest 2 and left in 2022 a year before the quest 3 released.</p>

   <p>Other games he made where Commander Keen,Quake, and RAGE but all 3 of these games were less successful than Wolfenstein and Doom causing them to have less sequels.Most games we have today wouldn't be as great without him since he donated algorithms, game engines and open sourced many great games.
