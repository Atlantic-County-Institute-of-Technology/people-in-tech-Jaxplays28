   <p> John Carmack was born August 20 1970.He attended the University of Missouri-Kansas for two semesters before  withdrawing to work as a freelance programmer.He would lock himself in his room for hour to learn how to code and program.In 1981 he released his first game Wolfenstein which was a hit causing to release 13 other games. The next game he made was Doom released in 1993 it doesn't have as many games with only 6 more being made but there is another one releasing in 2025.In 2013 he partnered with Oculus to make the quest 2 and left in 2022 a year before the quest 3 released.</p>

   <p>Other games he made where Commander Keen,Quake, and RAGE but all 3 of these games were less successful than Wolfenstein and Doom causing them to have less sequels.Most games we have today wouldn't be as great
